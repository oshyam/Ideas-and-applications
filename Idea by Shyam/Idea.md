# Idea:

## Making a web platform where visually Impaired people can do some minimal task using touch blocks.

* The can cammunicate through something like talkback
* They can do small task like setup alarm straight from webapp
* also planning to make the app working offline(pwa).

> There are many ideas but this is one of them closest to my heart.
