# Idea:

## Online Christmas card maker

* Web & Mobile
* Imagine waking up to an email from your close friend with Christmas wishes and a nice card attached to the body of the email. Youâ€™d like that, right? So I suggest you build that app.


* Authentication.
* Users should be able to choose a card template from a collection of templates.
* Users should be able to customize messages that go on the card and on the body of the email.
* Users should be able to send messages & cards to their loved ones via email.
